**Warning:** Minecraft now uses Identifier instead of ResourceLocation, this introduces sweeping
changes across the board. Compatible mods may no longer be compatible without manual porting. Also,
pre-1.21.11 versions are now developed on a separate branch, and they may no longer see feature
updates.

## Changes

* port to 1.21.11
* add special thanks section to README.md

## New Features

* Add item attribute modifiers (also known as loot modifiers) to runtime resource packs.

## Fixes

* add missing mob variants
